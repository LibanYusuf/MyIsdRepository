ISD lab sheet week 5
For the practical part of this lab please save the Python programs that you create and take screenshots of the execution (evaluation) of your programs. 
Consider this function: 
def mystery(x, y): 
                         result = (x + y) / (y - x)
                         return result 
What is the result of the call mystery (2, 3)? = 5.0
What does this program print? 
Def main ():
   	a = 5 
  	 b = 7 
   	Print (mystery (a, b))
Def mystery(x, y): 
   	z = x + y z = z / 2.0 
       	Return z 
Main () 
= 6.0
What does this program print?
Def main (): 
a = 4 
Print (mystery (a + 1)) 
Def mystery(x): 
y = x * x 
Return y 
Main ()
= 25
